            <h3>What is A yurt?</h3>
            <p>
                Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt 
                    is fully enclosed with canvas wal, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be
                open. 
                </p>

                <h3>How are that yurt finished</h3>
                <P>
                   Each yurt is furnished with a queen-sized bed with down quilt and 
                    gas-fire stove. Your luxury camping experience includes electricity 
                    and a sink with hot and cold water running. Shower and restroom
                    facilities are located in the lodge.

                 <p>
                Most guests pack comfortable and plan to dress for 
                    changing weather with light layer of clothing. It's also helpful to
                    bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!
